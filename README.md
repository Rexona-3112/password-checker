## 🔍 Analysis & Best Practices Learned

- **Length matters**: Passwords over 14 characters scored significantly higher.
- **Character diversity**: Using uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols boosts strength.
- **Avoid real words**: Reduces vulnerability to dictionary attacks.
- **Use of symbols between words**: Enhances unpredictability.
- **Leet-style substitutions**: Adds complexity (e.g., `@` for `a`, `0` for `o`).

---

## 🔒 Security Concepts

- **Brute-force attack**: Attempts every combination. Complex passwords resist better.
- **Dictionary attack**: Tries common words. Avoid real dictionary words.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Adds security with an extra verification layer.
- **Password managers**: Generate and store secure passwords.
- **Passphrases**: Easy-to-remember phrases with strong components (e.g., `Horse$Battery!Staple2025`).
